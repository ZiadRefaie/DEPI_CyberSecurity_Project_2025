## üìå Project Overview  
This project outlines the design and implementation of a **National Bank network infrastructure** using **Cisco networking devices** for routing and switching, integrated with **FortiGate NGFWs** for security, and fully simulated in the **GNS3 environment**.  

The network consists of:  
- **1 Headquarters (HQ)**  
- **4 Branches**  
- All interconnected securely through **WAN links**.

## üîí 1. The Challenge: Securing a National Bank  

Banks handle highly sensitive customer and financial data, making network design and security a top priority. The main challenges addressed are:  

- **Data Protection:** Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial data.  
- **Threat Mitigation:** Defend against malware, ransomware, phishing, and DoS/DDoS attacks.  
- **Secure Connectivity:** Enable secure HQ‚ÄìBranch and internet communication.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meet PCI DSS and banking data privacy requirements.  
- **High Availability:** Ensure redundancy for uninterrupted banking services.

## üõ† 2. Solution Approach  

The network combines **Cisco routers & switches** with **FortiGate NGFWs** for advanced security.  
The simulation is fully deployed in **GNS3**, offering flexibility for configuration, testing, and troubleshooting.  

### Key Elements  
- **FortiGate NGFWs** ‚Üí Firewalling, VPNs, and advanced security at HQ & branches.  
- **Cisco Routers & Switches** ‚Üí Handle routing, VLAN segmentation, and WAN links.  
- **HQ Redundancy** ‚Üí Dual routers, dual core switches, and VLAN separation for End Users, Servers, and Management.  
- **WAN Links** ‚Üí Simulated serial links between HQ and branches.  
- **End Devices** ‚Üí PCs, printers, ATMs, and servers simulated using VPCS.

## üìç 3. Project Scope  

### Headquarters (HQ)  
- **Routers:** 2 (ISP connectivity & branch links).  
- **Switches:** 2 √ó L3 Core + 2 √ó L2 Access.  
- **Servers:** DHCP, AAA, and System Logs.  
- **VLANs:** End Users, Servers, Management.  
- **Security:** 2 √ó FortiGate NGFWs in HA (Active/Passive).  

### Branches (4 Total)  
- **Routers:** 1 per branch.  
- **Switches:** 1 per branch.  
- **End Devices:** 3‚Äì4 PCs/Printers/ATMs per branch.  
- **Security:** 1 √ó FortiGate NGFW per branch.  

### Connectivity  
- **Internet:** HQ routers connect to ISP (via GNS3 Cloud).  
- **WAN:** Serial links connect HQ with each branch router.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. GNS3 Setup & Device List  

### Fortinet Devices  
- **HQ:** 2 √ó FortiGates (HA).  
- **Branches:** 1 √ó FortiGate each (√ó4).  
- **Total:** **6 FortiGates**.  

### Cisco Devices  
- **Routers:**  
  - HQ = 2  
  - Branches = 4  
  - **Total: 6**  

- **Switches:**  
  - HQ = 4 (2 √ó L3 + 2 √ó L2)  
  - Branches = 4 (1 each)  
  - **Total: 8**  

### End Devices (VPCS)  
- **HQ:** ~6 (Users + Servers: DHCP, AAA, Syslogs).  
- **Branches:** ~3‚Äì4 per branch.  
- **Total: ~20**
